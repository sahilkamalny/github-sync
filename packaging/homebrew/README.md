# Homebrew formula

This directory holds the Homebrew formula for GitHub Multi-Sync (`gh-msync`). The formula is used by the project’s tap so users can install with:

```bash
brew install sahilkamalny/homebrew-tap/gh-msync
```

For GitHub CLI extension mode, users install from the main repo:

```bash
gh extension install sahilkamalny/gh-msync
```

See the main [README](../../README.md) for installation and usage.
